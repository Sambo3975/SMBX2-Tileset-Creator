# SMBX2 Tileset Importer

_Note: This software is currently in early Alpha stage._

This program streamlines the creation of tilesets in SMBX2 by automating the most tedious parts of the process:
- Cutting the image with all your tiles into individual block-*.png images.
- Finding IDs for all the images
- Creating the .tileset.ini file in PGE.**

This program was designed for Windows and may not work right on other platforms. I figured this would be fine since
SMBX doesn't run on anything but Windows (or Wine) anyway.

** Some manual rearrangement will likely be necessary for tilesets with blocks not all the same size.
